  "summary": "A full-stack Internet Computer (DFINITY) vehicle inspection application delivered as a React + TypeScript frontend and Motoko backend canister. The backend stores vehicle inspections (vehicle details, photo metadata, remarks, PDF reference) and enforces role-based access control (admin/user/guest) with secret-token admin bootstrap. The frontend provides a multi-step inspection workflow (Internet Identity auth, validated vehicle details, pre-inspection checklist, camera photos with GPS+timestamp watermarks, remarks, report preview/print, and saving a PDF reference) orchestrated with TanStack React Query and an identity-bound actor setup. The app now also includes PWA install support (manifest, service worker, install prompt/help) and generated app icons.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Motoko canister uses Map-based in-memory state for inspections, per-user inspection indexes, and user profiles, with explicit authorization checks on each method.",
    "Authorization implemented as a reusable Motoko mixin (MixinAuthorization) over an AccessControl state module; admin bootstrap depends on an environment variable token.",
    "Backend includes a stable-state migration module converting older stored structures (List-based userInspections, older inspection type) to the current schema.",
    "Frontend uses InternetIdentityProvider (React context) wrapping the app to manage AuthClient, delegation validity, and login/logout state.",
    "Frontend uses a dedicated useActor hook that recreates the backend actor when identity changes and forces React Query cache invalidation/refetch for dependent queries.",
    "TanStack React Query is the primary data layer for backend reads/writes, with targeted cache invalidation on mutations.",
    "Frontend implements a wizard-like page flow managed in App state rather than a router (login → dashboard → details → photos → remarks → PDF preview).",
    "Photo capture is implemented client-side with MediaDevices + canvas watermarking; captured images are kept as data URLs and persisted temporarily in localStorage.",
    "UI styling uses TailwindCSS with theme tokens (OKLCH variables) and next-themes for light/dark mode; components resemble shadcn/ui patterns.",
    "Frontend includes a schema-driven pre-inspection form step (shared validation schema/utilities) integrated into the wizard flow before photo capture."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Backend VehicleInspection.timestamp is never set (initialized to 0 and not updated), making date-range queries and summary timestamps unreliable.",
    "Frontend “Generate PDF” is a simulated delay and uses window.print on rendered HTML; no real PDF generation or binary storage is implemented.",
    "Backend stores only PhotoMetadata (filePath, GPS text, watermark text, timestamp) and does not receive/upload actual image bytes; frontend keeps images only in localStorage as data URLs.",
    "LoginPage presents a mobile number + “Send OTP” flow, but authentication actually uses Internet Identity; the mobile number is not used server-side.",
    "Duplicate CSS files appear (frontend/src/index.css and frontend/index.css) with different variable sets, which can cause confusion or inconsistent theming depending on build setup.",
    "AccessControl.getUserRole traps with \"User is not registered\" for non-anonymous callers if initialization hasn’t happened yet; this can surface as runtime errors if methods are called before role assignment.",
    "Admin bootstrap requires CAFFEINE_ADMIN_TOKEN env var on the canister; missing configuration hard-traps during _initializeAccessControlWithSecret.",
    "Storing multiple full-resolution photo data URLs in localStorage can exceed browser quotas and fail silently/partially depending on device/browser.",
    "Dashboard shows recent inspections but lacks pagination/sorting controls; backend provides search endpoints that are not currently surfaced in the shown UI.",
    "Camera option is not working (user reports camera capture flow failing)."
