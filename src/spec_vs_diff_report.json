  "summary": "Frontend adds a real “My Reports” flow (Dashboard routes to new ReportsPage) and wires inspection/report listing to a React Query hook calling a backend method named getCallerInspectionSummaries. Photo capture UX/navigation appears improved with clearer error/retry messaging and direct navigation into the photo-capture step. However, the diff summary does not provide explicit evidence that the backend query API (getCallerInspectionSummaries) is actually implemented with the required access control and empty-list behavior.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement a backend query API that returns the current caller’s inspection summaries for the detailed inspection model (id, vehicle number, make/model, timestamp), enforcing the same access control rules as other user-facing inspection queries and returning an empty list for users with zero inspections.",
      "reason": "The frontend hook calls actor.getCallerInspectionSummaries(), but the provided backend diff snippet is truncated and does not show any added/modified query method implementation or its access-control/empty-list behavior. Only the InspectionSummary type is visible.",
