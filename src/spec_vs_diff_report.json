  "summary": "The diff improves PhotoCapturePage camera lifecycle and preview readiness handling, and adds a collapsible in-app CameraDiagnostics component shown only when an error exists. However, the diagnostics view does not include a detected camera devices count as required, and some REQ-1/REQ-2 acceptance items (e.g., explicit “Try Again” re-prompt behavior and error-type mapping) cannot be fully verified due to truncated diffs and lack of changes shown for the useCamera hook.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Diagnostics must include detected devices count (if accessible) along with HTTPS/secure context, navigator.mediaDevices availability, and last error message.",
      "reason": "The added CameraDiagnostics component checks secure context and API availability and shows last error, but does not attempt to enumerate devices or display a devices count (e.g., via navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()).",
